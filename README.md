## Description

This project was developed for the Alura One challenge. The goal was to create a decoder application based on a design provided in Figma.

The encryption "keys" that have been used are:
- The letter "e" is converted to "enter"
- The letter "i" is converted to "imes"
- The letter "a" is converted to "ai"
- The letter "o" is converted to "ober"
- The letter "u" is converted to "ufat"

##### Requirements:

- It should only work with lowercase letters.
- No accented letters or special characters should be used.
- It should be possible to convert a word to the encrypted version and also revert an encrypted word back to the original version.
